            <ul class="py-4">
                <li><b><i><u>1) EARLY LIFE</b></i></u></li>
                <p>Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot. He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm. He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and needy, dedicating his all for his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage. His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world. The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become goals of self-improvement especially for the youth of the country. For this very reason, his birthday, January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.</p>
                <li><b><i><u>2)EDUCATION</b></i></u></li>
                <p>Born Narendranath Dutta, into an affluent Bengali family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was one of the eight children of Vishwanath Dutta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi. He was born on January 12, 1863, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. Father Vishwanath was a successful attorney with considerable influence in society. Narendranath’s mother Bhuvaneshwari was a woman endowed with a strong, God-fearing mind who had a great impact on her son.</p>

                <p>
                As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest in music, both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan institution, and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling and body building. He was an avid reader and read up on almost everything under the sun. He perused the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied western philosophy, history and spirituality by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.</p>

            <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold" style="color: blue;"><u>Spiritual Crisis and Relationship with Ramkrishna Paramhansa</u></h3>
            <p>Although Narendranath’s mother was a devout woman and he had grown up in a religious atmosphere at home, he underwent a deep spiritual crisis at the start of his youth. His well-studied knowledge led him to question the existence of God and for some time he believed in Agnosticism. Earlier, to satisfy his intellectual quest for God, Narendranath visited prominent spiritual leaders from all religions, asking them a single question, “Have you seen God?” Each time he came away without a satisfying answer. He put forward the same question to Sri Ramkrishna at his residence in Dakshinewar Kali Temple compounds. Without a moment's hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna replied: "Yes, I have. I see God as clearly as I see you, only in a much deeper sense." Vivekananda, initially unimpressed by the simplicity of Ramkrishna, was astonished with Ramakrishna's reply. Ramakrishna gradually won over this argumentative young man with his patience and love. The more Narendranath visited Dakshineshwar, the more his questions were answered.</p>

                <P>He became rather still the inspiration of the youths and to pay homage to him his birthday on 12th January is celebrated as National Youth Day. We even today learn the true aim of scriptures and austerity from his works. Guru Bhakti? How can we forget that to serve the poor downtrodden people of the society he established the Ramakrishna Mission before the name of his Guru Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa?Vivekananda and Western Philosophy were like two sides of the same coin. This happened when Ramakrishna proved to him that he can visualize God like the way he can see Swamiji; this surprised him a lot as a person who had no traditional knowledge about Science, Literature, or the Culture of India, could visualize God. The very thought that awakened Swamiji was the spiritual knowledge that was beyond all moral ethics and values. He realized we worship God for us but his Guru worshipped God for the sake of mankind.</P>

                <h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold" style="color:yellow;"><u>Life and Work of Swami Vivekananda</u></h3>
                <p>A man with in-depth knowledge of Vedas; Upanishads; Bhagavad Gita and much more used to believe that serving mankind is to serve God and hence he was the person who can say "God gave me nothing I wanted but He gave me everything I needed." Happiness to him was a smile on the face of the poor. He was inspired right from his childhood due to her mother's religious nature and father's rational mind who was a then Lawyer.<br>


                    We all are aware of his knowledge and personality, but most of us are unaware that Swamiji was a brilliant singer. He used to enchant devotional songs on his own to keep his mind at a peaceful stake. It is due to this ability he came across Ramakrishna Dev who happened to hear young Narendra Nath sing a devotional song that impressed Paramhansa. He then invited Vivekananda to Dakshineshwar from where the life of Swamiji changed completely. <br>
                    
                    
                    The childhood wish to visualize God in front became a reality to Swamiji in the vicinity of Ramakrishna. Swamiji used to believe strongly that people are born to do good for the Nation with proper guidance.  The worship of one God as an idol was recognized by the Brahma Samaj which made Swamiji surprised during his college days from where the curiosity to see God arose. In one of his books, he expressed his gratitude to William Hastie, the then Principal of Scottish Church College, from whom Swamiji came to know about Ramakrishna.</p>

                <ul class="py-4">
                    <li><b><i>1) Founding of Ramakrishna Mission</i></b></li>
                    <p>Soon after his return to Kolkata, Swami Vivekananda accomplished another important task of his mission on earth. He founded on 1 May 1897 a unique type of organization known as Ramakrishna Mission, in which monks and lay people would jointly undertake propagation of Practical Vedanta, and various forms of social service, such as running hospitals, schools, colleges, hostels, rural development centres etc, and conducting massive relief and rehabilitation work for victims of earthquakes, cyclones and other calamities, in different parts of India and other countries</p>

                    <li><b><i>1) Founding of BELUR Math</i></b></li>
                    <p>In early 1898 Swami Vivekananda acquired a big plot of land on the western bank of the Ganga at a place called Belur to have a permanent abode for the monastery and monastic Order originally started at Baranagar, and got it registered as Ramakrishna Math after a couple of years. Here Swamiji established a new, universal pattern of monastic life which adapts ancient monastic ideals to the conditions of modern life, which gives equal importance to personal illumination and social service, and which is open to all men without any distinction of religion, race or caste.</p>

                <p>In June 1899 he went to the West on a second visit. This time he spent most of his time in the West coast of USA. After delivering many lectures there, he returned to Belur Math in December 1900. The rest of his life was spent in India, inspiring and guiding people, both monastic and lay. Incessant work, especially giving lectures and inspiring people, told upon Swamiji’s health. His health deteriorated and the end came quietly on the night of 4 July 1902. Before his Mahasamadhi he had written to a Western follower: “It may be that I shall find it good to get outside my body, to cast it off like a worn out garment. But I shall not cease to work. I shall inspire men everywhere until the whole world shall know that it is one with God.”</p>
